Common 3D print objects for use in CHILI
========================================

This is a repository where we store the designs and ready-to-print STLs for
parts that are used in the CHILI laboratory but are not specific to any project.

stock
-----

Contains 'stock' parts that may be reprinted when broken or when replicates are required:

  - *leapfrog-creatrhs-aftermarket-mods*: Improvement parts for the Leapfrog Creatr HS 3D printer.
    - *leapfrog-creatrhs-extruder-filament-guide-after-motor*: Fills the small gap remaining between
    the extruder wheel exit side and the second (smaller) guide tube; absolutely required for
    printing with flexible filaments.
    - *leapfrog-creatrhs-extruder-filament-guide-after-spool*: Used to mount the receiving end of the
    first (larger) guide tube to e.g a wall.
    - *leapfrog-creatrhs-default-fan-duct-v4*: Fan duct provided by Leapfrog for Leapfrog Creatr HS.
    - *leapfrog-creatrhs-fan-duct*: Improved fan duct for Leapfrog Creatr HS.
  - *32-92-spool-adapters*: Inner axle for mounting a spool with 32mm inner diameter and 92mm height onto a rod.
    - *32-92-17-spool-adapter*: Mounting rod is 17mm in diameter.
    - *32-92-20-spool-adapter*: Mounting rod is 20mm in diameter.
  - *53-55-spool-adapters*: Inner axle for mounting a spool with 53mm inner diameter and 55mm height onto a rod.
    - *53-55-17-spool-adapter*: Mounting rod is 17mm in diameter.
    - *53-55-20-spool-adapter*: Mounting rod is 20mm in diameter.

flexible-filament-tests
-----------------------

Parts to test flexible filament printing capabilities of a printer:

  - *traction-wheel*: Simple small wheel for e.g a toy tractor.
  - *flexible-link*: A link with a flexible part in the middle where ends are rigid. Test for dual printing.
  - *compression-spring*: Same as flexible-link but the flexible part is much less rigid thanks to a spring-like structure.
  - *ball-drive-wheel*: Small cylindrical wheel where the inner part is rigid and the outer ring is flexible.
  
stress-tests
------------

Parts to test regular rigid filament printing capabilities of a printer:

  - *cylindrical-thin-wall-without-infill-test*: Small vertical cylindrical tube with 0.8mm walls.
  - *hollow-cube-thin-wall-single-pass*: Small vertical square tube with 0.4mm walls.
  - *hollow-cube-thin-wall-without-infill*: Small vertical square tube with 0.8mm walls.
  - *overhang-test*: Overhang test from 45 degrees to 15 degrees with 5 degree decrements.
  - *pyramid-test-45*: Small hollow pyramid with 45 degree overhangs.
  - *pyramid-test-60*: Small hollow pyramid with 60 degree overhangs.
  - *pyramid-test-cylindrical-45*: Small hollow pyramid with cylindrical poles with 45 degree overhangs.
  - *pyramid-test-cylindrical-60*: Small hollow pyramid with cylindrical poles with 60 degree overhangs.
  - *small-cylindrical-feature-test*: Tiny cylinder with 2.8mm diameter.
